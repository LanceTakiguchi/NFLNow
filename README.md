* Note: Our API key has expired, and this project no longer is sustainable with the loss of API access.

## Version pv1.0

#### Description: Final Presentation Version
* Updated README to have links, a screenshot, a planned addtions section, learning section.
* Update API Key.

## The Learning Experince
This was my second hackathon, and it went much smoother. We decided
on an idea to use 4 different APIs based on a team member's love for
football. I was in charge with finding the API to give us the scores,
and I found an API with the scores, weather, stadium, etc. We started
to integrate this first into the user interface... when we realized
the scores were scrambled. Given it was a trial API key, they scrambled
the scores so that it was not accurate. Given we only care about using
APIs for the project, we went ahead and ran with it anyways. 

Having learned from the last hackathon, as a team we did much better 
communicating as well as paired programming. We had a clear NFL loving
leader to help guide the app into what he had in mind. We kept updating
our progress with each other and giving tasks as they appeared. The one
thing that could have improved would be divided tasks within a part. For 
example, once I finished my API and got it integrated and working,
I either helped others integrate their APIs, paired programmed, or was
given something to debug. If we had the main UI divided into tasks, then
it would be more clear what I could do. In the end, the app worked well,
and the leader always kept me busy, but it would have made my time
more seamless.

# c10_api_hackathon
Hackathon project involving the combination of different data sources into an application or game

### Requirements
- Combine at least 3 **external** resources via AJAX requests and present their information in an application
- Must be documented loosely on JSDOC standards
- Must be issue-managed via a a service like <a href="https://www.zenhub.io/" target="_blank">zenhub for github</a>, <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">trello</a>, <a href="https://www.meistertask.com" target="_blank">meistertask</a>, etc
- Should encorporate <a href="https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html" target="_blank">Google Material standards</a>

### Judging Criteria
- **Appeal** : is it visually appealing / well put together
- **Code Quality** : is the code properly formatted, are variables and functions well defined and documented
- **Presentation** : How well is it presented during the unveiling session
- **Task / Issue Management** : How well was the development process documented / controlled.  Were there well-defined issues, milestones, and project management
- **Innovative / Transformative** : Did the project do something new and exciting?  Was it bold and tried to do things that haven't been done much.  Did it combine the data sources together in a way that was more useful than either source by itself
- **Ease of Use / Understanding** : Was it easy to use the application / game, or if it was more complex, was the application or game able to provide you with tutorials or instructions that made understanding it a breeze.


### Deadline: 
- 12:00PM Thursday, August 3rd 2016
